# Chat Assistant — AishaMomStore Demo

A lightweight web chat assistant demo built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS that demonstrates streaming responses from a generative AI model. The assistant is preloaded with AishaMomStore business info so it can answer store-specific questions.

Features
- Minimal UI: plain HTML/CSS/JS chat window with streaming responses.
- System prompt seeded from business info for contextual replies.
- Conversation state stored client-side for basic session continuity.
- Example integration with the `@google/generative-ai` SDK (client-side demo).
